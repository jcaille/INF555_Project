Distances géodésiques sur un Mesh triangulaire

Exact Geodesic distances on a Tringular Mesh

How to use :
=====

- Launch Meshviewer.java
- The resulting distancefield is color-coded : Blue is closer to the source, Red is farther from the source
- Press 'S' to subdivise the mesh while keeping the same geometry.
- Change filename in Meshviewer.java to compute the distance field on another file
